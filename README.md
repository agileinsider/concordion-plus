concordion-plus
===============

Concordion Extensions for scenarios, useful for spec by example.

This is a graft of the concordion-plus source code from google to github. As part of the grafting exercise, the project has also been brought up to date to use the latest version of concordion and also incorporate an improved runner provided by https://github.com/raenur/Concordion-Plus/commit/ae837378d501687c0ec9d87e43a8a7a6999c2b7b which was created separately from an older version.
